    "In the previous chapters, we observed the effect of different kinds of errors ($X$, $Y$, $Z$) on the data qubits of a surface code. These errors can occur during idling or when gates are applied. Also, measurement errors can happen on the ancilla qubits during syndrome extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a round of syndrome extraction, we have a set of stabilizers whose measurement outcomes may have flipped. These flipped outcomes are known as syndrome defects. Recall that stabilizers only inform whether an error has occurred—not where it has occurred. Given this information, the primary job of the decoder is to figure out which errors could have led to the observed syndrome defects -- with this information, we can apply the appropriate corrections to fix the error without introducing a logical error.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have encountered a 1D version of the minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) decoder in our analysis of repetition codes. In that setting, the decoding problem was also 1D, as the generated syndromes are laid out in a 1D chain. It is important to mention that in realistic experiments, we repeatedly measure the stabilizers. The measurement errors between consecutive rounds create syndrome defects in time. Therefore, the decoding graph in the case of repetition codes becomes 2D: space (1D qubits) + time (1D). Similarly, in a realistic setting, the decoding problem of surface codes becomes 3D: space (2D qubits) + time (1D).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the actual decoding problem involves matching across space and time to correct for physical and measurement errors, respectively."

    "In the 2D grid layout of the surface code, a $Z$ or $X$ error on a data qubit lights up two syndromes (two nearby ancillas). Therefore, the matching graph contains two subgraphs: the $X$-matching graph and the $Z$-matching graph.\n",

We assume all data qubits undergo Pauli errors ($X, Y, Z$) with equal probability. However, for a depolarizing noise model, we can have $Y$ errors, which can be decomposed into $X$ and $Z$ errors.
